# Example Runner

Useless repo for useless me.

## Description

When I follow a book to learn to code and use Java, I like to structure the stuff into exercises.
And in the `main` method, select what I want to launch.

Since I am a Java dev, what better for this than to create a pom project with cicd in github ðŸ¤·.
